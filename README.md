# Project Name: Good-Readme Generator
[Application Demo Functionality - Recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BUay0mcf-ryKOu8grKm_qpng3JP7abIr/view)


# Description 
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
npm start
```


The user will then be prompted with a series of questions regarding their GitHub username and project.  Once complete, a "readme" file will be generated
with the user's information and responses.

## Technologies
This application uses the following: Node.js, Axios, Dotenv, and Inquirer.

## Experiences
Building this application was a challenge.  One of the challenging parts of building the application was being able to use user input in order to make an API
call using Axios.  Another challenge was being able to combine data from two different sources for use in generating the readme file.  Through this experience,
I learned more about using packages from npm, using an async function, and modularizing my application.
